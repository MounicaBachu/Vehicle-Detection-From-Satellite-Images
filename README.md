# Vehicle-Detection-From-Satellite-Images

Developed a system that can detect vehicle intrusion in the field, capture the intruder's vehicle, and classify them to protect the farm's property using satellite images. This helps in monitoring locations with limited or no infrastructure, without the need for human intervention, lowering labor and transportation costs.

Initial training data is annotated followed by training a machine learning model which is used to test the data and the model with highest accuracy is deployed to integrate with the user interface. Post this phase, a pipeline of test data from real time satellite images is sent to the model and The predictions from each model and any changes from the previous day will be notified to the client.
